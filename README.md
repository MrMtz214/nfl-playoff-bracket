## 🧠 Key Feature: Dynamic Reseeding
Unlike a fixed tournament bracket (like March Madness), the NFL **reseeds** teams after the Wild Card round. 
* This app automatically calculates the matchups based on the winners chosen.
* The **#1 seed** (Denver Broncos in the AFC, Seattle Seahawks in the NFC) is automatically paired against the **lowest surviving seed** for the Divisional Round.

## 📋 Current 2026 Playoff Field
### AFC
1. **Denver Broncos** (Bye)
